# JSON Schemas

A public collection of JSON Schemas for various Zing tooling. Used for allowing references directly from VSCode providing proper intellisense and validation.

In order to use a schema:

1. Select the branch containing your chosen schema
2. Navigate to the schema file and click **Raw**
3. Copy the Raw URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`)
4. Create a JSON file and paste the Raw URL into the `$schema` property at the top of the object
